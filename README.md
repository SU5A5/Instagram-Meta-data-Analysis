# Instagram Fake Profile Detection using Metadata

This project focuses on utilizing Instagram metadata to detect fake profiles using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed Instagram metadata attributes.
   - Visualized attribute distributions using histograms.
   - Explored attribute correlations.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Employed Standard Scalar to preprocess the data for modeling.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to build a simple Deep Learning model.
   - The model architecture consisted of layers designed for this classification task.

4. **Model Performance:**
   - Achieved an accuracy score of approximately 88%.
   - Evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Support metrics.
   - Created visualizations for training loss and validation loss.
